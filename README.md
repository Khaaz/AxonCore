# AxonCore
- A Discord Bot framework that handles custom Client, Commands, and Events.  
- Built on top of [Eris library](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris), it allows you to easily create a customizable bot with its easy to use options.  
- This framework will be simple to setup, simple to use, and allows high customizability and efficiency.  
- This framework is built to use a DataBase for utilizing all of its functionality. It natively supports MongoDB, but it is possible to use an alternate JSON DataBase if necessary.

## Features:

  - **Client**: Separates the Eris client and the main client that caches Modules, guildConfigs, DB schemas, etc...
  - **Modular**: A module that could host its own commands and events.
  - **Command Handler**: Creates a command easily with a lot of options and customization.
  - **Event Handler**: Listens to events sent by Discord API easily, splits / allows events per module.
  - **GuildConfig**: Natively supports guildConfigs (prefix, moderators, enabling / disabling modules / comands / events).
  - **Utility**: Useful shortcuts and utility functions.
  - **Resolver**: Built-in Resolver that can be replaced if needed.
  - **Error Handling**: Clean and feature rich error handling.
  - **Logging**: Colorful custom logging.
  - **Customizable**: Customize error messages easily, help command, bot staff, etc...
