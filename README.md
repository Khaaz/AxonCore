# AxonCore
- Discord Bot framework that handles custom Client, Commands, and Events.  
- Built on top of [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris), it allows you to easily create a customizable bot with its easy to use options.  
- Simple to setup, simple to use, and allows high customizability and efficiency.  
- Built to use a DataBase for utilizing all of its functionality. It natively supports MongoDB, but it is possible to use an alternate JSON DataBase if necessary.

## Features:

  - **Client**: Separates the Eris client and the main client that caches Modules, guildConfigs, DB schemas, etc...
  - **Modular**: A module that contains its own commands and events.
  - **Command Handler**: Creates a command easily with a lot of options and customization.
  - **Event Handler**: Listens to events sent by Discord API easily, splits / allows events per module.
  - **GuildConfig**: Natively supports guildConfigs (prefix, moderators, enabling / disabling modules / comands / events).
  - **Utility**: Useful shortcuts and utility functions.
  - **Resolver**: Built-in Resolver that can be replaced if needed.
  - **Error Handling**: Clean and feature rich error handling.
  - **Logging**: Colorful custom logging.
  - **Customizable**: Customize error messages easily, help command, bot managers, etc... 

## Notes:

This framework supports a custom logger. You can take full benefits of this by installing [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) or [Signale](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signale) and choosing the one you want to use in the config file.  
[PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is also recommended as a process manager solution.  
This framework is designed to work with [Moongose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) which you can install and use directly without any modification (just by selecting it in the config file).  
If you don't want to use MongoDB, you can use the default version which is a JSON Database.
In the future more database clients could be added. In the meantime you are able to use whatever Database you want by simply extending AxonCore.DBService, adaptating as you want and passing the Class as an option in the constructor.   

[Eris](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eris) is necessary to use this framework. However you can use any fork. [KhaaZ's fork](https://github.com/Khaazz/eris) is recommended as it only removes selfbot features from `Eris.Client` and prefix token as `_token`.  
You need to pass an instance of Eris Client when you contruct the AxonClient. Therefore you can use any Eris version you wish.   

[ESM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm) is used to run this framework. It allows to take full benefits of ES6 modules by making possible to use it.  
See [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm#getting-started) on how to use ESM.  
However you don't need ESM to use this framework as you can simply use require and it will be fully compatible.
